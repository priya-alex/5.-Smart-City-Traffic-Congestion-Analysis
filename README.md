5. Smart City Traffic Congestion Analysis
1. Description / Background
Urban cities face major traffic congestion, causing delays, fuel wastage, and pollution. IoT sensors, GPS, and historical traffic data can be analyzed to forecast congestion patterns and optimize traffic flow.
2. Problem Statement
•	Peak-hour congestion causes delays & accidents.
•	No predictive tool for traffic authorities.
•	Citizens lack real-time congestion alerts.
3. Task
•	Collect & preprocess traffic volume, GPS, and accident data.
•	Build time-series + ML models for congestion forecasting.
•	Develop Power BI dashboard for traffic authorities.
4. Objective
•	Forecast congestion for next 30/60 minutes.
•	Provide recommendations (rerouting, signal timing).
•	Reduce average commute time.
5. Scope
In scope: Traffic data analysis, congestion forecasting, dashboard.
Out of scope: Real-time traffic signal automation hardware.
6. Stakeholders
•	Primary: City traffic police, Smart city authorities.
•	Secondary: Citizens, Public transport agencies.
7. Data Needs
•	Historical traffic volume data (per road/zone).
•	GPS data from vehicles.
•	Accident reports.
•	Weather data (rain, fog impact).
8. Metrics
•	Average Vehicle Speed (km/h).
•	Congestion Index (%).
•	Forecast Accuracy (RMSE, MAPE).
•	Accident rate vs congestion levels.
9. Tools
Python (Pandas, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn), Power BI.
10. Deliverables
•	traffic_forecasts.csv
•	Jupyter notebooks for EDA & modeling.
•	Power BI congestion dashboard.
•	Final report with recommendations.
